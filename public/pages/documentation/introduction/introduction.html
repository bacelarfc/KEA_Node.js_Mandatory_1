    <h2>What is Node.js?</h2>
    <p>Node.js is a dynamic and flexible platform that has become one of the most popular tools for building modern web
        applications. As a student, I've found that Node.js offers a powerful and intuitive platform for building both
        server-side and client-side applications using a single language - JavaScript.<br>
        What I enjoy about Node.js is its vast ecosystem of libraries and modules. This allows developers to easily
        integrate third-party tools and functionality into their applications, saving time and effort in the development
        process.</p>
