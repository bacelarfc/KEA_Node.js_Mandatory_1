    <h1>Must-know node concepts</h1>
    <h2>Modules</h2>
    <p>In Node.js, every file is considered a module, which means that each module has its own scope and can export
        variables, functions, and objects for use in other modules. However, not everything in Node.js is a module. For
        example, the built-in modules and global objects provided by Node.js are not modules.</p>

    <h3>EC6 vs CommonJS</h3>
    <p>The import (ES6) feature, that allows modules to be imported in a more standardized and declarative way. Prior to
        ES6, modules were typically imported using CommonJS-style require() statements.
        In Node.js, the import statement can be used in place of the CommonJS-style require() statement when using
        ECMAScript modules (ESM). ESM is a standardized format for defining and importing modules that is supported by
        modern web browsers and Node.js versions 12 and above.
    </p>
    <h4>Here's an example of how to import a module using the import statement in Node.js:</h4>

    <div class="code-block">
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">// hello.js
                export function hello(name) {
                  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
                } </pre></code>

        <div class="code-block">
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">// app.js
                        import { hello } from './hello.js';
                        
                        hello("Maria"); </pre></code>
            <p>When a file is used as a module, it typically exports variables, functions, or objects that are made
                available to other parts of the program using the module.exports object or the export keyword.</p>

            <h2>Dependencies</h2>
            <p>A module may have dependencies on other modules or packages. These dependencies are listed in a
                package.json file and can be installed using npm.</p>

            <p>A package is a collection of related modules that can be shared and installed via NPM. A package can be a
                library, a framework, a tool, or an application. Packages are typically published to the NPM registry, a
                public repository of over a million packages that can be easily installed using the npm install command.
            </p>

            <p>To install a package, simply run the npm install command followed by the name of the package. For
                example, to install the popular express package:</p>

            <h5>npm install express</h5>
            <p>This command will install the express package and all of its dependencies in the node_modules directory.
            </p>
