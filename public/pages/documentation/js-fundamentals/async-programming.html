    <h1>Asynchronous programming</h1>
    <p>Asynchronous programming allows developers to write code that runs smoothly and efficiently. In traditional
        synchronous programming, your code executes line by line, and any task that takes a long time to complete will
        block the execution of the rest of the code until it finishes.
        Asynchronous programming solves this problem by allowing your code to continue running while it waits for
        long-running tasks to complete. This means that your application can be more responsive, and you can avoid
        blocking the main thread of your application.
        There are several ways to write asynchronous code in JavaScript, including callback functions, Promises, and
        Async/Await.</p>

    <h4>See examples:</h4>

    <h2>Callback Functions</h2>
    <p>A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is called back or
        executed at a later time when some event occurs or when a particular condition is met.</p>
    <div class="code-block">
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">function sayHello() {
    console.log('Hello!');
}
setTimeout(sayHello, 3000);
  </pre></code>

        <p>The setTimeout() function delays the execution of a function for a certain period of time. It takes two
            arguments: the function to be executed and the delay time in milliseconds.</p>

        <h2>Promises</h2>

        <p>A Promise is an object that represents a value that may not be available yet. Promises have two states:
            pending and settled. A Promise is settled when it is either fulfilled with a value or rejected with a reason
            for failure.</p>

        <div class="code-block">
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">fetch("www.domain.com/something")
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => console.log(data)); 
</pre></code>
            <p>In this example, the fetch() method returns a Promise that resolves with the response object. The first
                then() method converts the response object to JSON using the json() method. The second then() method
                handles the resolved Promise by logging the JSON data to the console. </p>

            <h2>Async/Await</h2>
            <p>Async/Await is a newer way of writing asynchronous code in JavaScript that provides an even cleaner
                syntax compared to Promises. Async/Await allows you to write asynchronous code that looks like
                synchronous code, making it easier to read and understand.</p>
            <p>Async/Await is actually built on top of Promises, so you need to understand Promises before using
                Async/Await. Promises are a way of representing a value that may not be available yet, and they provide
                a way to handle asynchronous code in a more structured way. Async/Await makes working with Promises much
                easier by allowing you to write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code.</p>

            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code class="language-javascript">async function fetchData() {
    const response = await fetch('https://www.domain.com/something');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
}      
    </pre></code>
                <p>In this example, the fetchData() function is defined as an async function. Inside the function, we
                    use the await keyword to wait for the result of the fetch() method, which returns a Promise. Once
                    the Promise is resolved, we assign the result to the response variable. We then use the await
                    keyword again to wait for the result of the json() method, which also returns a Promise. Once the
                    second Promise is resolved, we assign the result to the data variable. Finally, we log the data
                    variable to the console.
