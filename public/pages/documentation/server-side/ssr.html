    <h1>Server-side Rendering</h1>
    <p>Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique in which a web application's HTML is generated on the server, rather
        than on the client's browser. This means that when a user requests a page from a server, the server dynamically
        generates the HTML for that page and sends it to the browser, which can then render it.</p>
    <p>SSR can provide a number of benefits over client-side rendering, such as improved performance, better search
        engine optimization, and improved accessibility for users with slower or unreliable internet connections.
        However, it does come with some trade-offs, such as increased complexity on the server-side and potentially
        slower initial load times for large applications.
